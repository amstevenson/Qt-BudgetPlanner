Qt-BudgetPlanner
====

An application designed to work on more than one operating system without the need of changing specific hardware based programming variables around. Since Qt is designed to have moc files that handle the C++ extensions, which are one of the things that make it possible. Anyways...this includes: networking (json object parsing), QTableViews, hopefully QTableTrees, and a bunch of general nerdy stuff.
